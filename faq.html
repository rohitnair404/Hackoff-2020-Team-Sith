    <div class="accordion-item">
      <a>What is COVID-19?</a>
      <div class="content">
        <p>COVID-19 is the disease caused by a new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.  WHO first learned of this new virus on 31 December 2019, following a report of a cluster of cases of ‘viral pneumonia’ in Wuhan, People’s Republic of China.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-item">
      <a>What are the symptoms of COVID-19?</a>
      <div class="content">
        <p>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are <br>Fever<br>Dry cough<br>Fatigue</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-item">
      <a>Who is most at risk of sever illness from COVID-19?</a>
      <div class="content">
        <p>People aged 60 years and over, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, diabetes, obesity or cancer, are at higher risk of developing serious illness. However, anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age. </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-item">
      <a>Are there long term effects of COVID-19?</a>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Some people who have had COVID-19, whether they have needed hospitalization or not, continue to experience symptoms, including fatigue, respiratory and neurological symptoms.WHO is working with our Global Technical Network for Clinical Management of COVID-19, researchers and patient groups around the world to design and carry out studies of patients beyond the initial acute course of illness to understand the proportion of patients who have long term effects, how long they persist, and why they occur.  These studies will be used to develop further guidance for patient care.  </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-item">
      <a>How can we protect others and ourselves if we don't know who is infected?</a>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Stay safe by taking some simple precautions, such as physical distancing, wearing a mask, especially when distancing cannot be maintained, keeping rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds and close contact, regularly cleaning your hands, and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue. Check local advice where you live and work. Do it all!</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-item">
      <a>When should i get a test for COVID-19?</a>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Anyone with symptoms should be tested, wherever possible. People who do not have symptoms but have had close contact with someone who is, or may be, infected may also consider testing – contact your local health guidelines and follow their guidance. While a person is waiting for test results, they should remain isolated from others. Where testing capacity is limited, tests should first be done for those at higher risk of infection, such as health workers, and those at higher risk of severe illness such as older people, especially those living in seniors’ residences or long-term care facilities.  </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-item">
      <a>Is there a vaccine for COVID-19?</a>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Not yet. Many potential vaccines for COVID-19 are being studied, and several large clinical trials may report results later this year. If a vaccine is proven safe and effective, it must be approved by national regulators, manufactured, and distributed. WHO is working with partners around the world to help coordinate key steps in this process. WHO is working through the ACT-Accelerator to facilitate equitable access to a safe and effective vaccine for the billions of people who will need it, once it is available.  </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-item">
      <a>What about rapid tests?</a>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Rapid antigen tests (sometimes known as a rapid diagnostic test – RDT) detect viral proteins (known as antigens). Samples are collected from the nose and/or throat with a swab. These tests are cheaper than PCR and will offer results more quickly, although they are generally less accurate. These tests perform best when there is more virus circulating in the community and when sampled from an individual during the time they are most infectious.   </p>
